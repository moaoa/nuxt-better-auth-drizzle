### Nuxt Content Tip: How to query only specific fields

While working on a couple articles for this week, 
I notice that the best articles or the articles that get the most attention are the ones that have a nice GIF as the cover image.

## So I was like let me copy them and see how far I can get or if that actually get more reach than just a normal Image for the Cover image.
